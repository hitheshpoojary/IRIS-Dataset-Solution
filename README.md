<h1>PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS</h1>

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability. At the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance.
PCA is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is often used to visualize genetic distance and relatedness between populations. PCA is either done by singular value decomposition of a design matrix or by doing the following 2 steps:
1.calculating the data covariance matrix of the original data.
2.performing eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix.
